                <p class="text-light p-3">
                    Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being
                    called "stone," or as Rochambeau, roshambo, or ro-sham-bo) is a hand game, usually played between
                    two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
                    These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the
                    index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). The earliest form of "rock paper
                    scissors"-style game originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached
                    its modern standardized form, before being spread throughout the world in the early 20th century.
                </p>

                <p class="text-light p-3 pt-1">A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three   
                    possible outcomes: a draw, a win
                    or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock
                    crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[4]), but will lose to one who
                    has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors
                    cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately
                    replayed to break the tie.

                </h3>
                <p class="text-light p-3">
                    The players may start by counting to three aloud, or by speaking the name of the game (e.g. "Rock!
                    Paper! Scissors!"), raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down with each syllable onto their
                    other hand (or in a less common variant, holding it behind their back). They then "throw" or "shoot"
                    by extending their selected sign towards their opponent on what would have been the fourth count,
                    often saying the word "shoot" while doing so. Variations include a version where players throw
                    immediately on the third count (thus throwing on the count of "Scissors!"), a version including five
                    counts rather than four ("Rock! Paper! Scissors! Says! Shoot!", almost exclusively localized in the
                    United States to Long Island and some parts of New York City), and a version where players shake
                    their hands three times before "throwing".

                        THE ROCK

                    <p>
                        The rock is internationally recognized by a closed fist where the thumb is not
                        concealed. It is also one of the most popular opening moves and this is why it is
                        considered to be one of the most popular hand signals. Most players will view using the
                        rock as an opening move to be somehow aggressive but would still use it because it is
                        easy. The rock will beat scissors every time but will be beaten by paper.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="text-center lead bg-dark text-danger">
                        THE PAPER

                    <span class="h1"><i class="fa-sharp fa-regular fa-hand"></i></span>
                    <p>
                        Paper is delivered in the same way as the rock except that in this case all the fingers
                        and the thumb are extended in a way that they all face the same direction. The vertical
                        paper or the handshake is strictly forbidden in tournaments of Rock Paper Scissors
                        because it might resemble the scissors which can lead to unnecessary confusion. Paper is
                        one of the most challenging opening moves because there is no indication of what you
                        intend to do next. As a result, many players will be concerned when you use it as an
                        opening move to your game. Paper will beat rock but will be beaten by scissors in no
                        time.

                        THE SCISSOR

                    <span class="h1"><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-scissors"></i></span>
                    <p>
                        Scissors are thrown in the same way as rock where the hand is clenched into a fist but
                        the index and the middle finger are extended to the front in order to make an angle that
                        is of 30 to 45 degrees in a way that would resemble a pair of scissors. The use of
                        horizontal scissors is strictly forbidden in tournaments because they can resemble the
                        shape of paper. Opening with scissors is not a very smart move because your opponent
                        will be able to guess what your signal is going to be easily and so will be able to come
                        up with a stronger signal.
